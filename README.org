** Description:
- taggable
- post memes, screenshots
- write a short desc that can be used for fast lookup later.
- offline first, run ocr on it locally and maintain an index to be searched later.
- don't need a phone app, wpa will do
  - if not wpa must make use of telegram api somehow, but wpa preferred.
  - anonymous twitter account and use hashtags can be good for starters also
- no duplicate photos/memes
- issues
  - basically i need pinterest here, but the existing open source solutions suck balls
